		<h2> Favorite Manga : Hunter X Hunter </h2>
		<p style="color:white";> <i> Hunter X Hunter </i> is a manga written and drawn by Yoshihiro Togashi which is also known as the author of <i> Yu Yu Hakusho</i>. I think Hunter X Hunter is my favorite by so far. Basically, It's a story where we follow a young boy, Gon - One of the four mains characters, which is determined to become a "Hunter" in order to find his own father. The story begins as a Shounen but later the story become progressively darker, and more adult.  </p>
